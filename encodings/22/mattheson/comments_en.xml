          Right at the beginning it should be noted that where the leap from c# 
          to a# occurs, a b must be played in between the notes as an appoggiatura
          with a short trill.

          When thereafter everything has been neatly played up to the cadence in
          the eleventh measure, a melody has to be invented in the right
          hand and to be continued for about ten measures, up to
          the subsequent cadence to C#, approximately in the following manner:   
          <notatedMusic>
            <ptr target="music-example1.xml" />
          </notatedMusic>
        </p>
      </div>

      <div n="3">
        <head>§. 3.</head>
        <p>
          In the 19th measure, there is again a si suona, of which the meaning
          is known, and where the tutti enters, everything is possible <!-- ? -->
          which only sounds well. After the end of the first part, the right hand
          again begins to modulate, of which this may serve as an example: 

          <notatedMusic>
            <ptr target="music-example2.xml" />
          </notatedMusic>
        </p>
      </div>

      <div n="4">
        <head>§. 4.</head>
        <p>
           When the tutti is over, one may play like this until the next cadence: 

          <notatedMusic>
            <ptr target="music-example3.xml" />
          </notatedMusic>
        </p>
