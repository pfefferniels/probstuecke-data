          The first <ref target="#m-41 #m-42 #m-44 #m-45">four notes</ref> of this piece are to be
          played unbroken, with four full and short strokes, and on the
          <ref target="#m-50">fifth</ref> one should do a sharp trill in the lowest octave.          
          The <ref target="#m-137 m-142 m-144 m-146 m-152 m-154">first six notes</ref>
          in the fourth measure must be doubled with octaves,
          and this figure which immediately follows in the bass by transposition
          <note type="editorial" resp="#pfeffer">
            Here, the first edition reads "repercussion" instead of "transposition".
          </note>
          must be used in the right hand.

        <p>
          In the last half of the mentioned <ref target="#m-101">fourth measure</ref>
          the right hand has to play six times per crotchet. This
          must be observered throughout all similiar cases. These crotchets are,
          as you can see, composed of eight notes and are broken down into as many parts.
          I remind this because otherwise it might seem strange to the reader
          that in just one crotchet he should play six times with his right hand.
          The <ref target="#m-176">fifth measure</ref> again requires octaves and in the
          treble the above mentioned figure begins, transposed and starting from
          <hi rendition="#b">e</hi>: with which the
          <ref target="#m-229">sixth</ref> and <ref target="#m-276">seventh measure</ref> alternate as well,
          each in its own tonality.

      <div n="3">
        <head>§. 3.</head>
        <p>
          The <ref target="#m-327">eighth bar</ref> develops the already described interlude
          three times in ascending degrees in the right hand, while
          the bass is doubled, in this way:
          <notatedMusic>
            <ptr target="music-example2.xml" />
          </notatedMusic>
          In the <ref target="#m-405">ninth bar</ref> the very first subject occurs in again.
          Here the treble can easily find a subtle melody in quavers
          and the bass can be played full-voiced. In the <ref target="#m-415">tenth bar</ref>
          the trill on the first note must not be forgotten; but there is nothing to
          remind about the <ref target="#m-423">eleventh</ref>.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div n="4">
        <head>§. 4.</head>
        <p>
          The <ref target="#m-468">twelfth bar</ref> must be played full-voiced in the bass,
          while the right hand can make use of everything that has been there in the
          previous measure only by turning the <hi rendition="#b">g</hi> into
          a <hi rendition="#b">d</hi> and continuing that way. The
          <ref target="#m-533">thirteenth measure</ref> is to be played as written.
          The <ref target="#m-588">first half of the fourteenth</ref> measure requires the
          little interlude to begin in the treble:
          <notatedMusic>
            <ptr target="music-example3.xml" />
          </notatedMusic>
          The same can be done in the first half of the <ref target="#m-651">fifteenth measure</ref>
          but transposed down by a tone, and in the
          <ref target="#m-763">seventeenth measure</ref> one only observes what has been said in § 1.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div n="5">
        <head>§. 5.</head>
        <p>
          Now it has been hinted at in § 3. how to deal with notes as those occurring in
          <ref target="#m-928">m. 21</ref> and <ref target="#m-947">m. 22</ref>.
          But if someone wants to make a variation here, it is so much more pleasant to listen to.
          But let the trill be recommended again in m. 22, namely in the low
          octave. It cannot harm if someone wants to try this trill with the
          right hand in sixths at the same time.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div n="6">
        <head>§. 6.</head>
        <p>
          Now we turn around the motive in <ref target="#m-962">m. 23</ref> a little
          and take it in the right hand as it can be seen in the next beats in the
          bass: but a third higher. An enthusiast of counterpoint will take the
          opportunity to note that both motives can be inverted back- and forward.
          However, Although it is not really our intention to bring it out that way on the keyboard
          nor is it possible to do it in all the pieces.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div n="7">
        <head>§. 7.</head>
        <p>
          In <ref target="#m-1078">m. 25</ref> the simple subject of the beginning occurs once more.
          Since it now can be heard for the fourth time it fairly deserves
          an ornamentation in the right hand. The usual counter-subject has to be taken from the
          fourth measure in my opinion, and should be played there as well as
          here in that way:
          <notatedMusic>
            <ptr target="music-example4.xml" />
          </notatedMusic>

          So you can see that these things are not just whims, empty motives, unordered and wild ideas
          or dry basses. Rather, everything is connected and
          there is almost no note to be found that does not have its certain relation with the others.
          After having played to counter-subject a couple of times it may well be
          varied for the third and fourth time in that way.
          <notatedMusic>
            <ptr target="music-example5.xml" />
          </notatedMusic>
        </p>
      </div>

      <div n="8">
        <head>§. 8.</head>
        <p>
          What happened in the 23rd measure occurs again here, mutatis mutandis, in the
          <ref target="#m-1117 #m-1191 #m-1247">sixth-, seventh and twenty-eighth measure.</ref>
          The last six notes in <ref target="#m-1373">m. 30</ref> also require a special treble.
          And then one can play the end as firmly as one's fingers can.
